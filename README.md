# DuckDodgers
(CS 3700) Places Duck Dodgers, Marvin the Martian, and the Illudium Phosdex on a hex map.
This program allows the user to input lava blocks and utilizes two linear list objects to find the shortest path for both Duck and Marvin;
whoever reaches the Illudium Phosdex first wins!

However, there is a twist; Duck Dodgers has his sidekick, Gandalf, that will intercept Marvin's path if a tie happens.
